# Balloon Inflator Game

A fun interactive game built with **Phaser.js**, where you inflate a balloon by clicking on a pump button. As the balloon inflates, a random letter appears on it. Once inflated, the balloon can be released, floating across the screen, and eventually popping when clicked. 

This project demonstrates the use of Phaser.js for game development, handling interactive elements, animations, and particle effects.

## Features

- **Inflate Balloon**: Click on the pump to inflate the balloon.
- **Random Letters**: A random letter appears on the balloon each time it inflates.
- **Balloon Movement**: After the balloon is released, it floats randomly across the screen.
- **Burst Effect**: Clicking on the balloon triggers a burst effect with particles.
- **Full-Screen Toggle**: Press `F` to toggle between full-screen and windowed mode.
- **Responsive Design**: The game automatically resizes to fit the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Phaser.js**: A fast, robust, and versatile 2D game framework.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For basic styling (if needed).
